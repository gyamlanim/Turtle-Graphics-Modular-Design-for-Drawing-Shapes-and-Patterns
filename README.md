# Turtle-Graphics-Modular-Design-for-Drawing-Shapes-and-Patterns

### Project Summary and Learnings

This project involved creating three Python modules using Turtle graphics to draw shapes, random images, and rows of images. The goal was to gain a deeper understanding of functions, loops, randomness, and modular programming in Python. Each module builds upon the other, emphasizing different concepts like user input, randomness, and the Turtle library's graphical capabilities.

- **TurtleShapes.py**: The first module introduced the creation of geometric shapes. i wrote two functions: one that draws a square and another that draws house using multiple colors and geometric shapes. This module emphasized understanding how to manipulate Turtle graphics and how to write functions that accept parameters (size and turtle) to control the shapes drawn.

- **DrawRandom.py**: This module expanded on TurtleShapes by introducing randomness. It prompts the user for the number of shapes to draw and their function choice (either the square or house). Shapes are drawn at random locations with random sizes. The focus here was on using the `random` library, handling user input, and integrating **modular programming** (where a program is divided into separate modules that can be reused across different parts of the program).

- **DrawRow.py**: The final module focused on drawing rows of shapes, where each row contains shapes of the same size but different from other rows. This module further solidified the concepts of loops (nested loops) and using functions with parameters to control the drawing process.

### Key Learnings:
1. **Modular Programming** (where a program is divided into independent modules that can be reused and maintained separately): By writing functions that can be reused across multiple modules, we practiced the importance of code organization and reusability.
2. **Randomness in Drawing**: We learned how to apply the `random` module to generate random sizes and positions, allowing us to create dynamic and diverse images.
3. **Turtle Graphics**: The Turtle library allowed us to explore how visual graphics can be created programmatically, providing insight into how artists and designers might use programming in their work.
4. **Function Parameters and Return Values**: This project emphasized writing functions with parameters to make them flexible and adaptable to different contexts.
5. **User Input**: Handling user input to control which shapes or designs to draw and the number of repetitions was another key learning that demonstrated how to make interactive programs.
